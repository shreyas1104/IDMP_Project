# Modeling Deaths for Diabetes & Kidney Diseases, Globally

Authors: Shreyas Dikshit, Amare Diotte, Tay Goodwin, Aditi Gupta

This project provides valuable insights into the future death rates for diabetes and kidney disease in various countries and highlights the importance of investing in preventative healthcare measures and improving access to healthcare infrastructure.
 
The death rates would be predicted for a particular year (eg. 2019) by building a machine learning model such as linear regression on previous years’ data (eg. 2010 or 2015). The model would be evaluated against the actual available death rates for 2019 and would be iteratively improved until the error in prediction reduces.

The results of this project have significant meaning and impact, as they provide valuable insights into the future death rates for diabetes and kidney diseases in various countries, across the world. By using historically available data and building a machine learning model, we were able to predict future death rates for these diseases and identify influential factors, such as government health expenditure, a country's GDP, and access to technology and sanitation facilities.
